# Project Information: Learning HTML and JavaScript

This markdown file is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn the fundamentals of HTML and JavaScript. It will serve as a place to take notes, track progress, and document what I have learned.

## Progress Tracking
### Day 1 (JavaScript)
- **General Notes**:
- Statically typed = Types are check before runtime (C++)
- Dynamically typed = Types are checked at runtime (Python & JS)
- Strongly typed = Doesn't allowing mixing of data types without explicit conversion (Python)
- Loosely typed = Allows type mixing by doing automatic conversion e.g. coercion (JavaScript)
    - This is why Javascript can be a bit more tricky when data types are mixed 
- Convention dictates using camelCase in JS rather than snake_case in Python
- Data types that hold single values are the same as python e.g. int, float, string and boolean
- Browser specific functions;
    - **alert:** shows a message in the browser
    - **prompt:** shows a message in the browser and returns a value 
    - **confirm:** shows a message asking the user pick betwen two options which return true or false
