# Project Information: Learning HTML and JavaScript

This markdown file is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn the fundamentals of HTML and JavaScript. It will serve as a place to take notes, track progress, and document what I have learned.

## Goals
- Understand the basics of HTML structure and elements.
- Learn how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to web pages.
- Build a small project to practice and reinforce concepts.

## Progress Tracking
### Day 1
- **HTML**: Learned about basic tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>`.
- **JavaScript**: Explored `console.log()` and `alert()` and basic syntax.

### Day 2
- **HTML**: Practiced creating lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) and links (`<a>`).
- **JavaScript**: Learned about variables (`var`, `let`, `const`) and data types.

## Notes
- HTML is not case-sensitive, but it's good practice to write tags in lowercase.
- JavaScript is case-sensitive, so be careful with variable names.
